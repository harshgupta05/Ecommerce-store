# Ecommerce-store
Users can add items to their cart and checkout to successfully place an order. Every nth order gets a coupon code for 10% discount and can apply to their cart.
The store also has two admin API's:

    Generate a discount code if the condition above is satisfied.
    Lists count of items purchased, total purchase amount, list of discount codes and total discount amount.

### System SetUp Steps :

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/harshgupta05/Ecommerce-store.git

### Install Python and flask in your system 

if python is already installed in your system just check the version :

    python3 --version 

    pip install flask
  
    flask --version

### Run the application locally

    python app.py 

* When you run a Flask application locally, it starts a development server. To interact with your application, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/, where 5000 is the default port that the Flask development server uses. This allows you to access and test your Flask web application on your local machine.

### Unit Test Cases 

Run the tests:
* Install pytest

      pip install pytest

* Run the test case

      pytest
